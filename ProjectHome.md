**Update December 26th 2009:** The second beta is now available for download. This one is a bit more stable than the first one, and it has some bugs fixed. Still it should not (yet) be used in a professional production environment. If you find any issues or have feature requests about this release, please report it on this site.

**Update December 19th 2009:** The first beta is now available to download. Please take note that this is a beta release and it should not (yet) be used in any professional production environment. If you find any issues or have feature requests about this release, please report it on this site.

**Update December 4th 2009:** I'm currently aiming at releasing the first beta version of Three CMS on January 1st 2010. Creating an installer is the first thing on my todo-list now. There will be some functionality that is not fully implemented, and I expect there will be some bugs too, but that's why they call it a beta. Please keep your eyes on this site for any updates on this...

# What is Three CMS? #

Each self-respecting web developer has at one point in his life created his own CMS. In my time as a web developer I've created two, and am starting on a third CMS (hence the name 'Three'). Completely open source.

The CMS is based on the principle: Why re-invent the wheel? Therefore the CMS shall be based on some fundamental frameworks:

  * Code Igniter; to provide a solid base to develop on.
  * Smarty; to provide a template engine with a wide variety and functionality
  * jQuery; to provide nifty Javascript features and AJAX functionality
  * CKEditor; to provide rich text editing at the backend.

The CMS stores it's data on a revolutionary new way, by seeing each piece of content as dataobject, which can contain more dataobjects of different kinds. This way of working is highly flexible and can be used to make complex websites in just a jiffy. On the other hand it's also ideal for creating a small website on the go!
Some core features of the CMS will be:

  * Multilingual from the core; No need to create duplicates of entire websites.
  * Pure MVC; Mode-view-controller syntax, Code Igniter style.
  * Modularity; create a CMS that is extendable with contributors content.
  * Optimization; create code that is fast and slick.
  * SEO; Friendly URL's, meta data, everything.
  * Small footprint; No need to uploading 1000+ files to a webserver for installing a new website.

# Contribute #
**If you would like to contribute, please drop me an e-mail at giel.berkers@gmail.com.**

I am always looking for:
  * Code Igniter gurus
  * MySQL enthusiasts
  * PHP progammers
  * Artworkers
  * People with experience with CMS creation
  * ...Or if you think you can help this project in any other way!
